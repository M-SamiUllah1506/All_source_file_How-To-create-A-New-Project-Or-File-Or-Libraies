What is Redux?
Redux is a library for managing data (state) that is shared across many components or the entire application.

What is "State"?
State is any data that can change and affects what the user sees on the screen. The video breaks it down into three types:

Local State: Data used by only one component (e.g., text in an input field). Usually managed with React's useState hook.
 sd s
Cross-Component State: Data that affects a few components (e.g., a state for showing/hiding a pop-up modal).

App-Wide State: Data that affects the whole app (e.g., user login status).

How is State Managed?

For local state, useState is enough.

For cross-component and app-wide state, you can pass data and functions down through many components (called "prop drilling"), but this can get complicated.

The Solution for Complex State:

Both React Context (built into React) and Redux (a separate library) solve the problem of "prop drilling" by making it easier to share state across many components.

Redux stores shared state and efficiently triggers updates only where they are needed.

Here is a quick summary of the video's main points.

This video explains the potential disadvantages of using React Context, which is why a tool like Redux can be a better choice in some situations.

You Don't Always Need Redux: If the potential downsides of Context don't affect your project, you don't need Redux. You can also use both Redux and Context in the same application.

Here are the two main disadvantages of React Context discussed:

Complex Setup in Large Apps:

For big applications, you might need to wrap your code in many different Context Providers, leading to deeply nested and messy JSX code.

The alternative is creating one giant Context Provider to manage everything, but that component becomes very large and hard to maintain.

Performance Issues:

React Context is great for state that doesn't change often (like a website theme or login status).

It is not well-optimized for "high-frequency" updates (state that changes very frequently), which can lead to performance problems.

In conclusion, Redux is presented as an alternative that solves these specific issues of complexity and performance in large-scale applications.
