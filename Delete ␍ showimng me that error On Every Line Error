Delete ␍ showimng me that error
The ␍ character you're seeing is a Carriage Return character (\r), and it's usually a line-ending issue — especially if you're working on Windows.
It likely means your file is using CRLF (Windows-style line endings), but some tools like Prettier, ESLint, or Git want LF (Unix-style).
✅ Fix: Change Line Endings to LF (Unix-style)
Open the file in VS Code.

In the bottom-right corner, you'll see something like:
CRLF
Click on CRLF.
A menu will pop up → Select LF.
Save the file (Ctrl + S).
This converts all line endings to LF, fixing the issue.
